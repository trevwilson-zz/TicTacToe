Initial Project 2 Design

Coming into this project, we both feel that there are a few challenges ahead of us that must be overcome.

First of all, we need to think about exactly how all of our interfaces and classes are going to interact with each other and what methods and attributes we will need within each.  Initially, we don't think we will need any classes beyond  those specified in the eLC document. For the TicTacToeBoard object, we plan on using a 2-dimensional array to represent the 9 spots on the board, and we will set each part of that array equal to a letter to mark each move. For players, we need a way to ask them to make a move, for them to decide to make a move, and for them to actually make the move.  For the main class, we need to take turns asking players to make moves, checking each time to see if they win the game.

Second, we need to worry about the AI design for each ComputerPlayer.  For the Naive player, we will just go through our 2-dimensional array checking to see if each is open, and pick the first one that is empty. For Random, we will generate a random number between 1 and 9, and we will mark that spot if it is open. For Cutthroat, we will need to go through the series of moves specified in the eLC assignment, making the highest priority move possible.

Those are the main two challenges we think we will need to overcome, although obviously more will arise as we go.  However, we think we have a pretty good idea of what we are trying to do and the challenges we will need to overcome.
