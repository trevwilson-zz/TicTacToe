Project 2 Reflection

Looking back, we were pretty accurate in our views of how we needed to solve the problem and the issues we might have run into.  The biggest part that we struggled with was programming the Cutthroat Computer Player AI. Although we knew this would be a challenge, we didn't foresee the amount of code we would need to implement each priority move, and the difficulty in making sure it was always making the right move.  We were largely right about the AI for the Naive and Random Computer Players, as they have extremely simple processes for deciding which spot to mark.  The Human player was also relatively straightforward, and we only had to account for a few possible exceptional cases.  We didn't struggle too much with the interaction between all of the classes and interfaces, although we had to make quite a few changes as we went along in order to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of our program.  We didn't find much of a need for the ComputerPlayer class, beyond simply further categorizing the different types of players, as there weren't any real attributes that were shared between all computer players but not the human player.  All in all, we didn't have any major problems that we couldn't overcome, and we found ourselves working very efficiently in our pair.  We both agreed that we made less simple syntax errors and also had better logic and more efficient algorithms when we could both discuss what would be the best option for the situation. We ended up with a successful program that was pretty close to our original specifications.
